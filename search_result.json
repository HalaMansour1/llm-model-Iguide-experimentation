            "contents": "While High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources are powerful for tackling complex, computationally intensive analysis and modeling problems, access to these resources varies across disciplines. Domain scientists in a variety of fields such as social and environmental sciences often lack in-depth technical skills (e.g., familiarity with terminal, knowledge of job schedulers) to effectively utilize HPC resources, hindering desired research. In this context, CyberGIS-Compute is a middleware toolkit designed to democratize HPC access with the main goal of enabling domain scientists in diverse fields to solve computationally intensive problems. A key challenge facing model developers on CyberGIS-Compute is to create a containerized software environment for their models. Domain experts unfamiliar with HPC are generally unfamiliar with containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Singularity) and thus unable to create/test containers to execute their models. But if they have access to science gateways, they would want to use these familiar software environments on HPC resources. This paper describes a novel approach to integrating the Cern Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS) into CyberGIS-Compute to provide consistent software environments across science gateways and HPC resources.",

Near real-time analysis of urban heat enables quick decision-making and timely resource allocation, thereby enhancing the well-being of urban residents, especially during heatwaves or electricity shortages. To serve this purpose, we develop a cyberGIS framework to analyze and visualize human sentiments of heat exposure dynamically based on near real-time location-based social media (LBSM) data. Large volumes and low-cost LBSM data, together with a content analysis algorithm based on natural language processing are used effectively to generate near real-time heat exposure maps from human sentiments on social media at both city and national scales with km spatial resolution and census tract spatial unit. We conducted a case study to visualize and analyze human sentiments of heat exposure in Chicago and the United States in September 2021. Enabled with high-performance computing, dynamic visualization of heat exposure is achieved with fine spatiotemporal scales while heat exposure detected from social media data can be used to understand heat exposure from a human perspective and allow timely responses to extreme heat.",

We have used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of biodiversity that has been collated to date; it will be useful to researchers and international efforts wishing to model and understand the global status of biodiversity.",
